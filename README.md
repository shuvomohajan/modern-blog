# Discription
This Project is about a simple blog site where a user can create a blog and the other users can view that post from their side.

# Dependencies
## Tailwind
To avoid the error log from vscode, after installing the pakages you need to create a folder named **.vscode** and inside that folder create a **settings.json** file. After that add those lines:

```json
{
    "css.validate": false,
    "tailwindCSS.emmetCompletions": true
}
```
